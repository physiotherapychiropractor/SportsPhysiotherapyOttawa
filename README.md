## Instant Pain Relief

Some physically aggressive sports such as rugby and football may require instantaneous pain-relieving measures for the players. Physical therapy techniques such as hot and cold packs, taping of damaged parts, and dry needling may help keep the pain at bay. Physiotherapy treats muscular tension. It targets the problem area before more testing is done. This rapid pain relief helps athletes to reduce dependence on opioid medications for their pain management.

## What is a sports physiotherapist?

A multi-faceted position is held by [sports physiotherapists ottawa](https://www.kentchiromed.com/sports-physiotherapy-in-ottawa/), which can include:

*   Evaluation of injuries: This involves careful, thorough questioning regarding the present injury as well as any previous injuries. It also requires a complete examination of the entire body.
*   You must identify the root cause. It is important to assess the causes of the injury.
*   Individualised treatment plans are developed to address any weaknesses or imbalances. We want an athlete to come back stronger from their injury to prevent re-occurrence.
*   You can improve strength and mechanics in other areas of the body. It is crucial, particularly if athletes need to rest for a while.
*   It is important to give them realistic timelines so that they can return to their sport. You only get this ability with practice. Injuries heal at different rates in different people.
*   Work as part of multi-disciplinary teams. This might be your immediate team. This could be the coach, parent, manager or sports doctor, or may need to be referred to an extended team, e.g. sports psychologist or dietitian
*   Injury prevention: Identifying all risk factors for injury that are modifiable and developing a plan to eliminate them.

Let's take a closer look at some of these elements.

## How does Sports Physiotherapists evaluate your Injury?

Sports physiotherapists will not only assess the injury area, but will also evaluate the entire kinetic chain that is involved with the particular movement patterns of each sport. One example is that a soccer player will receive a different evaluation than a runner. This will identify why the injury occurred in the first place and allow a specific treatment programme to be implemented. Also, they will want to know about your current training routine, weekly loads, and major competitions. This will ensure that your treatment is customized to your specific needs.

A barrage is also used by sports physiotherapists (wouldn't it be more useful?). A variety of tests and equipment are used to gather objective information to establish a baseline level for your strengths and weaknesses. Injury is a very frustrating experience for athletes. This is one of the best ways to motivate and keep athletes interested. Sports physiotherapists must have this skill.

A sports physiotherapist can create a profile for an athlete using objective data. Let's look at some examples.

*   A good alternative to MRI is ultrasound, as it can visualize the muscles, tendon and joint structures.
*   To identify key imbalances in your muscles, a thorough assessment of your length and muscle strength is conducted using several validated and reliable testing.
*   The specialist equipment used for testing your muscle strength (concentric-eccentric and isometric). Complete Physio, for example, has an isokinetic and hand-held dynamometers. It will allow us to benchmark your strengths against others or compare the strength of other people. It can help identify areas of weakness and muscle imbalance that should be fixed.

## Treatment For Athletic Injuries

Sports physiotherapists can do their best to avoid injuries but accidents happen. Sometimes, contact sports injuries can be more severe than those that are treated by physiotherapists and require even surgery. Physical therapists are able to create treatment plans that guarantee a quick recovery and lower costs. Recent research shows that physical therapy can cut costs for patients by nearly 72%. Most injuries can be treated with minimal specialized surgery.

## How Do Sports Physiotherapists Treat Your Injury?

In sport, it's all about the 'marginal' gains and the treatment of sports injuries is no different. Sports physiotherapists continue to look for new equipment and treatment methods that will speed up athletes' recovery.

An experienced sports physiotherapist has the ability to perform 'hands-on' treatments and is well trained in techniques such myofascial release, joint manipulation, and other soft tissue techniques. They are skilled in injury management and rehabilitation. To help with your recovery from an injury, many people have trained in strength and conditioning. Lack of strength is often a key risk factor for many joint, tendon and muscle injuries and forms a key part of most treatment regimes and injury prevention programmes.

It is possible to sustain serious injuries in sports. Often, a team approach will be required to return an athlete on the right track. You may need to have your surgeon and sports physician review the situation. You need to ensure that everyone involved in your health care is working well together. The team around you is essential. Complete Physio boasts a talented team that works with many world-renowned athletes doctors and surgeons. They will ensure your injury is fully understood and you have all possible treatment options.

These services can help speed up your recovery and get you back on the right track. While these services aren't necessary for all situations, they may be an excellent adjunct to therapy. We provide all these services; If you would like to discuss these in more detail please do not hesitate to contact us.

Shockwave therapy (also known as ESWT - Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy)

Shockwave can be used to address many tendon conditions, including those related specifically to running. It is recommended that you attend at least three sessions. This should be completed in conjunction and a rehabilitation program.

Occlusion Therapy

After operations, or when an athlete wants to build strength and muscle bulk in a very short time frame (hypertrophy), occlusion may be applied. However, it is not recommended for athletes who are putting extra weight through the joints. The majority of strength training takes place at 70 to 80% of a 1-rep maximum (1RM). Occlusion therapy is able to improve muscle strength and bulk up to 30% below a maximum of one repetition (1RM). This means less joint compression and ultimately less pain whilst exercising but still encourages the gains required.

It is a great way to gain strength quickly. The quadriceps are and hamstrings will be strengthened by this. You can use it to correct imbalances in your quadriceps or hamstring. You have the option to only work one type on the machine. If you feel weak or eccentrically working on the muscles when they are lengthening, then the machine will isolate this phase. This is a great way to improve the precision of rehabilitation.

Ultrasound guided injections

The use of ultrasound-guided injections to help reduce the pain associated with some sports injuries can prove useful. They should not be used for injury where pain is a limiting factor in rehabilitation. The anti-inflammatory effects of steroid injections and hyaluronic Acid can reduce pain significantly. These can help speed up recovery and offer a chance to participate in rehabilitation programmes.

When you're pain-free, your treatment doesn't stop. This biggest risk factor to injury is having the same injury as previously. It is common for sports injuries to recur. In the case of Achilles tendon problems, it can be as high as 50%. A good prevention program is crucial for all athletes. The prevention of injury is another specialty for sports physiotherapists.

The ideal situation is that we prevent injuries before they even occur. This is a very special area. The growing amount of scientific evidence on sports injuries is helping us to understand how we can avoid them. This may involve load monitoring and management, lifestyle management, diet/nutrition advise and more technical analysis e.g. Re-training.

Education and resource sharing is an important part of any treatment. It is important that athletes have a thorough understanding of what happened, the reasons behind it and how to prevent it from happening again.

## Muscle and joint flexibility

A key component of evaluating an athlete's potential is joint flexion. A lot of sports need flexibility. However, the demands for each sport will vary. In order to perform at their best, swimmers as well as gymnasts need more flexibility. It is possible to avoid injuries by being flexible.

## Prevent Athletic Injury

The wrong training technique can cause muscle injuries, torn ligaments and even broken bones. Your strengths and weaknesses can be assessed by a sports physiotherapist who will then design an individual training program. The information acquired is used to map out a routine that may reduce the chances of you developing strains, stress, muscle cramps, or torn ligaments.

## Physical Fitness

Boxing, for example, requires athletes to be strong enough to withstand the physical demands of the sport. The physical therapist will help strengthen the muscles, ligaments, and joints. A physical therapist can assist you in improving your performance and reaching your full potential. With enhanced physical strength, you can withstand high physical stress during matches.

## Relaxation

It is equally important to cool down after a tiring day on the track. As it allows athletes to relax and unwind from a tough workout, physical therapy for sports is essential. This allows athletes to unwind, relax and regain their energy for a better body.
